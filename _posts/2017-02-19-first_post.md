Hi there! Thanks for stopping by, I hope you'll enjoy your time on my page! This is the first post of a hopefully long list of articles that will cover various topics : Data Sciences, Data Engineering, Algorithms, Data Structures...

There's a French expression that litteraly translates to "being as proud as a peacock", well I'm definitely hapy to finally be running my own page! I believe every new milestone should include a thank you note, mine will give credits : shoutout to [HTML5 Up][HTML5], who designs amazing templates including [Phantom][Phantom]. Also, thanks to [Andrew Banchich][AndrewBanchich] for making a Jekyll version out of it! Last but not least, big thanks to [Unsplash][Unsplash] for all of their amazing photos.

I guess we're ready to go and start writing. Let's keep in touch, cheers!
