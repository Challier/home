<h1>You just found the boring part about the writer's life</h1>
<p>I'm Victor, a French guy born in London and raised in Paris (0% English, 100% French thankfully). I studied Engineering &amp; Data Sciences, and I spend a lot of time playing rugby or the piano.</p>

<p>In September 2015 I started a one year internship in a predictive marketing company in the Silicone Valley, <a href="http://www.agilone.com/">AgilOne</a>. It was a very exciting experience. I got to learn a lot about the startup culture and the tech industry, both are topics I have been actively following ever since. Now I'm heading to Barcelona to start my end of course internship in one month, hopefully I'll have fun there!</p>
<p>You're done with the boring part, now enjoy your read! For the even more wholesome people out here, feel free to share your thoughts and ideas about the posts!</p>
